Description: A set of tools for metabarcoding (i.e. amplicon
        metagenomics) experiment planning and analysis. Has functions
        for parseing out taxonomic information from diverse metadata
        (e.g. sequence headers), for taxonomically- balanced
        subsampling of items with associated taxonomy information (e.g.
        sequences), and for making publication-quality graphics showing
        distributions of taxon statistics over taxonomic/phylogenetic
        trees.
