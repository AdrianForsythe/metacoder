Description: A set of tools for metabarcoding (i.e. amplicon
        metagenomics) experiment planning and analysis. Has functions
        for parseing out taxonomic information from diverse metadata
        (e.g. sequence headers), for manipulation of items with associated taxonomy information (e.g.
        sequences), and for making publication-quality graphics showing
        distributions of taxon statistics over taxonomic/phylogenetic
        trees.
