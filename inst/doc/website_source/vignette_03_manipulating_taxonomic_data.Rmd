## Introduction

Manipulating taxonomic data is a more subtle problem then it might seem at first.
For example, if you want to remove a taxon, do you remove its supertaxa and subtaxa as well?
What if there are sequences assigned to that taxon; are the sequences removed or reassigned to a preserved supertaxa?
What if the taxon is an internal node in the taxonomy; do you connect it parent and children taxa or break the taxonomy?
The answers to these questions depend on what the goal of the subsetting is.
MetacodeR uses `dplyr`-style functions for manipulating taxonomic data.
For each `dplyr` verb, there are two functions in metacodeR, one that manipulates the taxon portion of the data and one that manipulates the item portion.

### Subsetting rows: `filter_taxa` and `filter_items`

#### Removing supertaxa

Often, there are many shared ranks in the taxonomic hierarchy that can prevent effective visualization:

```{r}
plot(genbank_ex_data,
     vertex_size = item_counts,
     vertex_color = item_counts,
     vertex_label = name)
```

`filter_taxa` can easily remove these taxa by filtering by rank or selecting the root taxon by name:

```{r}
filter_taxa(genbank_ex_data, taxon_ranks > 5) %>%
  plot(vertex_size = item_counts,
       vertex_color = item_counts,
       vertex_label = name)
filter_taxa(genbank_ex_data, name == "Basidiomycota", subtaxa = TRUE) %>%
  plot(vertex_size = item_counts,
       vertex_color = item_counts,
       vertex_label = name)
```


#### Removing subtaxa

You can also remove subtaxa by filtering with a specified level/rank:

```{r}
plot(unite_ex_data_3,
     vertex_size = item_counts,
     vertex_color = item_counts,
     vertex_label = name,
     tree_label = name)
filter_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, taxon_ranks < 5) %>%
  plot(vertex_size = item_counts,
       vertex_color = item_counts,
       vertex_label = name,
       tree_label = name)
```

Or we can filter by the number of items assigned to each taxon:

```{r}
filter_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, item_counts > 3) %>%
  plot(vertex_size = item_counts,
       vertex_color = item_counts,
       vertex_label = name,
       tree_label = name)
```

This is useful when plotting very large data sets, since it is difficult to make effective visualization of over 1000 taxa.
Note that items assigned to removed subtaxa are reassigned to the closest parent taxa that passes the filter by default.
You can prevent this by setting the `reassign_items` option to `FALSE`:

```{r}
filter_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, taxon_ranks < 5, reassign_items = FALSE) %>%
  plot(vertex_size = item_counts,
       vertex_color = item_counts,
       vertex_label = name,
       tree_label = name)
```


#### Removing internal taxa

You can also remove internal taxa:

```{r}
filter_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, taxon_ranks != 3) %>%
  plot(vertex_size = item_counts,
       vertex_color = item_counts,
       vertex_label = name,
       tree_label = name)
```

Like items, children of removed taxa are reassigned to the closest supertaxon that passes the filter.
Although it usually does not make much sense to not do this, it is possible:

```{r}
filter_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, taxon_ranks != 3, reassign_taxa = FALSE) %>%
  plot(vertex_size = item_counts,
       vertex_color = item_counts,
       vertex_label = name,
       tree_label = name)
```


#### Filtering items 

Filtering items assigned to taxa is less complicated:

```{r}
filter_items(unite_ex_data_3, ) %>%
  plot(vertex_size = item_counts,
       vertex_color = item_counts,
       vertex_label = name,
       tree_label = name)
```

You can remove any taxa that are made itemless by the filtering using the `itemless` option: 

```{r}
filter_items(unite_ex_data_3, , itemless = FALSE) %>%
  plot(vertex_size = item_counts,
       vertex_color = item_counts,
       vertex_label = name,
       tree_label = name)
```


### Sampling rows: `sample_n_taxa` and `sample_n_items`

Random sampling of taxa and items is similar to subsetting, except you provide weights to each item or taxon indicating how likely it is to be included in the subset.
The random subset of taxa or items is then passed to `filter_taxa` or `filter_items` respectively.
Therefore, all the options of `filter_taxa` or `filter_items` can be used within `sample_n_taxa` and `sample_n_items`.

#### Sampling items

Sampling items is useful for making a subset of a large data set (not that the example below uses a large data set):

```{r}
sample_n_items(unite_ex_data_3, size = 100)
```

Weights can be assigned to items to determine how likely each is to be sampled:

```{r}
sample_n_items(unite_ex_data_3, size = 100, item_weight = )
```

You can also assign weights to items based on the taxon they are assigned to: 

```{r}
sample_n_items(unite_ex_data_3, size = 100, taxon_weight = 1 / item_counts)
```


#### Sampling taxa

Taxa can be sampled the same way items are sampled:

```{r}

```

When randomly subsetting taxa, pay special attention to the options of `filter_taxa` as this can have a drastic effect:

```{r}

```

#### Sampling a fraction of the total

`sample_n_taxa` and `sample_n_items` have simple wrappers called `sample_frac_taxa` and `sample_frac_items` that sample a given proportion of the total number of rows:

```{r}
sample_frac_items(unite_ex_data_3, size = 0.5)
```


### Subsetting columns: `select_taxa` and `select_items`

Subsetting columns is more straight forward that subsetting rows.
The functions `select_taxa` and `select_items` are little more that wrappers for `dplyr::select`.
The only thing they do differently is to enforce that the `taxon_ids`, `parent_ids`, and `item_taxon_ids` columns are preserved:

```{r}
select_taxa()
```


```{r}
select_taxa()
```


### Adding columns: `mutate_taxa` and `mutate_items`

Adding a column to either `taxon_data` or `item_data` is easy using the `dplyr` syntax:

```{r}
mutate_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, new_col = "Im new!")
```

A convenient attribute of `dplyr::mutate` is the ability to reference newly created columns:

```{r}
mutate_taxa(unite_ex_data_3,
            new_col = "Im new!",
            newer_col = gsub(pattern = "!", replacement = "er!!", new_col))
```

Adding item columns with `mutate_items` works the same way.


### Replacing columns: `transmute_taxa` and `transmute_items`

`transmute_taxa` and `transmute_items` make new columns and discard all of the old columns:

```{r}
transmute_taxa(unite_ex_data_3,
               new_col = "Im new!",
               newer_col = gsub(pattern = "!", replacement = "er!!", new_col))
```


### Reordering rows: `arrange_taxa` and `arrange_items`

The way `classified` objects are defined, the order of all of the components do not matter.
This means its easy to reorder them to fit your needs:

```{r}
arrange_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, item_counts)
```

To change the direction of ordering, use `dplyr::desc`:

```{r}
arrange_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, desc(item_counts))
```
