## UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Metacoder is still under active development and might not always work correctly until this notice is removed.
It is being developed on the Ubuntu operating system.
It should probably work on IOS and Windows. 


## MetacodeR

`MetacodeR` is an R package that provides a set of tools for:

- Evaluating potential metabarcoding primers/loci for taxonomic specificity and discrimination.
- Standardized parsing of taxonomic information.
- Visualization of statistics distributed over taxonomic classifications.

To accomplish these goals, metacoder leverages resources from other R packages, interfaces with external programs, and provides novel functions where needed to allow for entire analyses within R. Using R means that metacoder is entirely open-source, works on the Linux, Windows, and Apple operating systems, and is seamlessly integrated with the best free tools for statistical analysis.
