There are three primary taxonomy-specific criteria that should be met when creating an ideal set of reference sequences for evaluating metabarcoding primers.
I say "taxonomy-specific" because there are obviously other considerations that deal with sequence characteristics, such as quality and the presence of primer binding sites, but these will be dealt with separately.

The three taxonomy-specific criteria are: 

1. taxonomic coverage: All taxa of interest should be represented by enough sequences to capture their diversity.
2. balance: The number of sequences for each sub-taxon should be approximately equal, so that estimates for the parent taxon are not biased for a particular child. 
3. size: A reference sequence set should be the minimum size that meets the above two criteria, since this allows for computationally intense analyses. 

Online sequence databases typically do have these characteristics, even those designed for metabarcoding. 
Sequences are not available for many taxa and the numbers of sequences vary dramatically for different taxa. 
For these reasons, a simple random sample of sequences for a given taxon from an online database will often not constitute an ideal reference sequence set. 
Therefore, `metacoder` includes functions to extract a sample of reference sequences that meet these criteria from a larger set of sequences. 

When evaluating potential primers for metabarcoding experiments it is important to have reference sequences representative of every taxon of interest.
The number of sequences of each taxon at each taxonomic level should be approximately equal, or perhaps more accurately, proportional to the diversity within that taxon.
If the sequence of a given locus correlates with characters used to determine taxonomy, as is the case for an ideal barcoding locus, the number of sub-taxa should be proportional to diversity of a given taxon.
