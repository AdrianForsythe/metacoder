Metacoder: An R package for the analysis and visulization of treatment effects on complex microbial communities

Metacoder is a tool kit for metabarcoding-based community ecology, focusing on visualization of complex taxonomic data and in silico primer/barcode evaluation. Complex hierarchical data from metabarcoding is difficult to plot effectively. Stacked bar charts are used, but are ineffective when plotting multiple taxonomic ranks, many taxa, or multiple treatments. Metacoder aims to easily integrate quantitative data from thousands of taxa and multiple treatments in intuitive tree-based plots. Data from one or more treatments are mapped to size/color of tree parts and differences are highlighted. This allows for rapid and intuitive exploration of data and information-rich publication-quality graphics. Metabarcoding is revolutionizing our understanding of pathogen ecology by avoiding the culturability bias, but the effect of locus and primer choice is difficult to predict. Metacoder is meant to evaluate the specificity of primers and the resolution of barcode loci. In-silico PCR and effective plotting allows for quick evaluation of primer specificity and barcode gap analysis estimates error rates. The ability to quickly test new primers/loci will allow for culture-independent analysis of the ecology of diverse and understudied group of pathogens such as oomycetes. Metacoder is currently being applied to describe the diversity of oomycetes in nursery-grown rhododendron rhizosphere and the effects of oomycete disease in controlled inoculations.
