### All testing platforms using R devel (rhub, winbuilder)

Some bioconductor packages in Suggests seem to not be available for R 4.2. I get the following error on R devel builds: 

Error: Bioconductor does not yet build and check packages for R version 4.2

However, all of the bioconductor packages are optional and not needed for most functionality.
